>> Calculate the area and perimeter of shapes

>>  Write a Java program to create a class called "Shape" with abstract methods for calculating area and perimeter, and subclasses for "Rectangle", "Circle", and    
    "Triangle".

Note: An abstract class is a class that is declared abstractâ€”it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be      
      subclassed.

      An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon).
